If you would like to access the Cloud9 environment later, by default it will pause after
after 30 minutes. While paused, you only pay a fee for the storage allocated (~ $0.10 / GB / month)
and nothing for compute.

If you would like to terminate your Cloud9 instance, follow these instructions:

- Go to your [Cloud9 Environment](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home)
- Select the environment named **workshop** and pick **delete**
